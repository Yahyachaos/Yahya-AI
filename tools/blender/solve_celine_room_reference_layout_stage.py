"""Staged extension of the canonical reference-constrained room solver.

This module deliberately reuses the canonical projection solver instead of
applying proof-time furniture transforms. It adds only measured secondary
objects to the same auditable screen-space solve. Source GLB bytes remain
immutable and accepted transforms are written on the normal instance anchors
by the base solver.

Proof #47 confirmed the mirror, #48/#50 corrected the front nightstand, #49
corrected the large plant, and #51 corrected the small plant from a large
left-floor object to the measured tiny right-bedside target. The next largest
clean, directly measured scale mismatch is `room_wall_shelf_books`: Proof #51
projects it at about 19.4% x 17.0% of the frame while the reference target is
10.3% x 8.0%, with nearly correct horizontal center. Solve only this wall anchor
for position/height/scale/yaw against the existing medium-confidence target.
Preserve camera, already solved anchors, source GLBs and proof-time geometry.
